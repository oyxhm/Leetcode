/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money
 * stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system
 * connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of
 * money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
